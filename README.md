# PySimpleTextToEpub
Most of the Text to Epub scripts available deal with lots of Meta Data, Author information. This repo was created to counter this. The Text file is first converted to PDF by using a script (https://github.com/baruchel/txt2pdf) and from there further converted to Epub. No Fuss just plain Text to Epub
